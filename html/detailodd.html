                    <h3>DESCRIPTION</h3>
                    <p>I had the opportunity to take on the role of UI/UX Designer for the very first website project of a perfume brand called ODD Fragrances. This project marked a significant milestone both for the brand and for me professionally. From the initial stages, I was actively involved in briefing sessions and collaborative meetings with the development team and the graphic design team. Through clear communication and shared goals, we were able to align on the brand's vision and translate it effectively into a digital platform. <br> <br>

                    My responsibilities included crafting the complete user flow to ensure a seamless and intuitive navigation experience for users. I designed multiple key pages for the website, including the landing page, collection page, journal page, contact page, and location page. The design concept focused on simplicity and minimalism, which reflects the refined essence of the brand. By using a muted color palette and clean layouts, I aimed to convey a sense of elegance and sophistication while maintaining a user-friendly interface. <br><br>
                        
                    This project not only allowed me to sharpen my design skills but also gave me the chance to collaborate across disciplines, understand the brand's identity on a deeper level, and deliver a cohesive and aesthetically pleasing digital experience that enhances the way users interact with ODD Fragrances online.</p>
