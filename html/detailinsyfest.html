                    <h3>DESCRIPTION</h3>
                    <p>Ready is a job-matching and professional upskilling platform designed to help users discover career opportunities while also evaluating and developing the skill sets needed to stand out in competitive job markets. The platform not only curates job listings from verified companies but also helps filter candidates based on skill relevance, proficiency, and career goals â€” making the hiring process more focused and efficient for both job seekers and recruiters. <br><br>

                    This application was developed as a prototype for the Insyfest UI/UX Design Competition, where I collaborated with my teammates Rafael Marvin, Natasya Felicia, and Callista Althea. Our vision was to create a platform that goes beyond simply listing job vacancies. We wanted to provide users with a space where they could also assess their readiness for a job through built-in skills categorization and recommended courses to improve their qualifications.<br><br>
                        
                    As a UI/UX Designer on this project, I was responsible for crafting a clean, modern interface that ensures an intuitive user experience. The design embraces a minimalist aesthetic with high accessibility and functional hierarchy. Key features of Ready include: A smart job search engine with filters by location, industry, and skill, A personalized dashboard displaying job matches, learning progress, and recommendations, Categorized courses such as UI/UX, Front-End, Back-End, Security, and more, A user profile section with resume upload, portfolio management, and certification tracking, Incentive and reward systems to encourage users to complete their profiles and courses<br><br>
                        
                    Ready stands out by aligning job listings with specific skill standards and by guiding users through a tailored learning path based on their chosen career direction. This provides users with clarity and motivation, allowing them to bridge the gap between where they are now and where they aim to be professionally.</p>
