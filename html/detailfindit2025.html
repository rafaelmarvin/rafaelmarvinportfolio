                    <h3>DESCRIPTION</h3>
                    <p>This project was developed as a specialized learning application designed specifically for children with dyslexia. The goal was to create an inclusive and supportive platform that could help young learners improve their reading abilities through interactive and engaging experiences. <br>

                    The development of this application was a collaborative effort carried out during the FindIT UGM 2025 Hackathon. I worked closely with a multidisciplinary team: </p><br>
                    <ul>    
                    <li>Jerry Febriano, who took on the role of Hacker, was responsible for all the coding and technical development of the app. </li>
                        
                    <li>Natasya Felicia, the Hipster, served as the designer and crafted the visual identity and UI elements of the application.</li>
                        
                    <li>Rafael Marvin, the Hustler, focused on the sustainability aspects, business background, and supporting documents such as the Business Model Canvas (BMC), Value Proposition Canvas (VPC), TAM SAM SOM analysis, and milestone planning. 

                    </li><br>
                    </ul>    
                    <p>
                    The application's interface was thoughtfully designed to be friendly, intuitive, and child-appropriate, featuring bright colors, simple navigation, and adorable characters to keep users engaged. It includes several learning modules that guide children through phonetic exercises, letter recognition, and word formation, all designed with the needs of dyslexic learners in mind.<br><br>
                        
                    Our team aimed not only to build a functional prototype within the hackathon's limited time but also to present a complete product strategy backed by strong business logic and clear value propositions. Through this experience, we were able to merge creativity, empathy, and innovation to address an important educational challenge in a meaningful way.</p>
