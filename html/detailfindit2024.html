                    <h3>DESCRIPTION</h3>
                    <p>WeCan is a mental wellness platform designed to support Gen Z in their emotional and psychological well-being through a blend of gamified experiences and practical self-care tools. Developed using the MERN stack, WeCan encourages users to maintain a balanced state of mind through tasks, journaling, and personalized mood tracking — all while earning points as motivation. <br><br>

                    This project was created for the FindIT 2024 Hackathon at Universitas Gadjah Mada, where our team successfully achieved 4th place. Our multidisciplinary team consisted of: </p>
                        
                    <ul>    
                        <li>Joseph Christian : Hacker (Developer) </li>
                            
                        <li>Alicia Felisha : Hipster (UI/UX Designer)</li>
                            
                        <li>Rafael Marvin : Hustler (Business & Sustainability Lead) 
    
                        </li>
                        <br>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                    As a team, our mission was to build a platform that felt warm, safe, and empowering for young users — especially in today's fast-paced digital world where mental health is often overlooked.<br><br>
                        
                    Key features of WeCan include: Interactive Dashboard: Tracks user progress and overall wellness score.  Mood Tracking & Journaling: Allows users to log emotions and write reflections. Daily Quests/Tasks: Small achievable goals to boost mood and sense of productivity. Point-based Motivation System: Earn “Wellness Points” as a reward for consistency. Statistics & Insights: Visual charts that help users understand patterns in their mental well-being.<br><br>
                        
                    WeCan is more than just a mental health tracker — it’s a daily companion that promotes self-awareness and self-care in an engaging and non-intrusive way. By combining design, tech, and business insight, we aimed to make wellness accessible and relevant for the next generation./p>
