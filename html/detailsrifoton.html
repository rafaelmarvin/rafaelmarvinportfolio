                    <h3>DESCRIPTION</h3>
                    <p>Sparks is a smart electricity usage monitoring application designed with a specific focus on students and young adults living in shared accommodations such as dormitories or rented rooms. The goal of this app is to help users track and understand the electricity consumption of individual devices in their homes, enabling smarter, more efficient energy usage and potentially reducing electricity costs. <br><br>

                    The app was developed as a prototype for the Srifoton competition organized by Universitas Sriwijaya. I collaborated with Puput Novita and Natasya Felicia to bring this concept to life. Together, we worked to ensure the design not only functioned well technically but also resonated with our target audience â€” individuals who are often on tight budgets and seeking ways to manage their living expenses more effectively.<br><br>
                        
                    As the UI/UX design lead on this project, I focused on creating an interface that was visually appealing yet highly functional. The design emphasizes clarity, simplicity, and a dark-themed aesthetic for a modern and sleek user experience. Some of the core features of the app include : Real-time tracking of power consumption by individual devices, Historical electricity usage graphs for daily, weekly, and monthly views, Device-specific breakdowns that show which electronics consume the most power, A user dashboard that summarizes energy data and provides actionable insights<br><br>
                        
                    Sparks empowers users to make better energy decisions by providing data in a digestible and visually intuitive format. It was built with the intent to spark awareness and responsibility around energy consumption, particularly for young renters who are just beginning to manage their own living spaces independently.</p>
