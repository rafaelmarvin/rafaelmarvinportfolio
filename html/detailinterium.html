                    <h3>DESCRIPTION</h3>
                    <p>TransitPlus is a web-based application designed to promote the use of public transportation in the Greater Jakarta area (Jabodetabek) by offering a point-based reward system. Users can earn points every time they choose eco-friendly transit options such as Transjakarta, MRT, LRT, and KRL. These points can later be redeemed for various discounts and rewards, encouraging a shift toward more sustainable commuting habits. <br><br>

                    I worked on this project as the UI/UX Designer, collaborating with my teammates Jerry Febriano and Reynaldo Marchell, who were responsible for the development and technical implementation of the platform. Our target audience primarily includes Gen Z users and urban professionals, as they represent key demographics that frequently commute and are open to digital solutions that add value and convenience to their daily routines.<br><br>
                        
                    As the designer, I focused on creating a seamless, user-friendly experience that incorporates clear navigation, a modern interface, and gamified elements such as travel history tracking, profile progression, and reward unlocking. The application includes several key features.<br><br>
                        
                    TransitPlus was developed as a prototype for the Interium Evolution Web Design Competition, where it was awarded first place. This recognition affirmed both the technical excellence and the real-world applicability of our project. Through this experience, our team was able to explore the intersection of digital design, behavioral change, and urban mobility, all while building a solution that could potentially improve public transport usage in a meaningful way.</p>
